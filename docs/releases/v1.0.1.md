# Cello v1.0.1 -- Production-Ready Release

**Release Date:** February 24, 2026
**License:** MIT
**Python:** 3.12+
**Codebase:** 32,000+ lines of Rust, 6,000+ lines of Python
**Tests:** 394 passing

---

## Overview

Cello v1.0.1 is the culmination of ten iterative pre-release versions, marking the framework's transition from beta to a production-ready, enterprise-grade web framework. With this release, Cello's entire public API is frozen under [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) -- no breaking changes will be introduced until v2.0. Developers can depend on Cello for production workloads with full confidence in API stability.

At its core, Cello is built on a simple but powerful principle: **Rust owns the hot path, Python owns the developer experience.** Every TCP accept, HTTP parse, route lookup, middleware execution, JSON serialization, and response assembly happens in Rust. Python is responsible only for route registration, handler function pointers, and business logic. The result is C-level request throughput with the ergonomics of a modern Python web framework.

Benchmarks show Cello sustaining **170,000+ requests per second** with 4 workers (5 processes) using wrk (12 threads, 400 connections, 10s) -- **1.9x faster** than BlackSheep+Granian, **3.1x faster** than FastAPI+Granian, and **5.9x faster** than Robyn. This performance comes not from a single optimization but from a holistic approach: single-threaded Tokio runtime per worker (zero GIL contention), SIMD-accelerated JSON, zero-copy radix tree routing, arena allocators, handler metadata caching, lazy parsing, multi-process SO_REUSEPORT workers with os.fork(), ultra-fast response bypass, and an aggressively optimized release build profile. Every microsecond on the hot path has been scrutinized and eliminated where possible.

## Performance

### Benchmark Results

| Framework | Requests/sec | Avg Latency | p99 Latency | Relative |
|:----------|:------------|:------------|:------------|:---------|
| **Cello v1.0.1** | **170,000+** | **2.8ms** | **15ms** | **1.0x (baseline)** |
| BlackSheep + Granian | ~92,000 | 4.3ms | 13ms | ~1.9x slower |
| FastAPI + Granian | ~55,000 | 7.1ms | 17ms | ~3.1x slower |
| Robyn | ~29,000 | 14.2ms | 38ms | ~5.9x slower |

*All benchmarks: JSON serialization (`GET /` returning `{"message": "Hello, World!"}`), 4 workers (5 processes each), wrk (12 threads, 400 connections, 10s). Results vary by hardware and workload.*

### What Makes Cello Fast

**SIMD JSON (`simd-json 0.13`):** JSON parsing and serialization leverages CPU SIMD instructions (SSE4.2, AVX2) for hardware-accelerated processing, achieving up to 10x the throughput of Python's built-in `json` module. On non-SIMD architectures (e.g., ARM), Cello automatically falls back to `serde_json` for compatible JSON handling.

**Zero-Copy Radix Tree Routing (`matchit 0.7`):** Route matching uses a compile-time-optimized radix tree with O(log n) lookup and zero heap allocations per request. Path parameters are extracted without copying strings.

**Arena Allocators (`bumpalo 3`):** Per-request arena allocation groups all transient allocations into a single contiguous memory region that is freed in one operation, eliminating heap fragmentation and reducing allocator pressure.

**Handler Metadata Caching:** Whether a handler is `async def` or `def` is determined once at first invocation and cached. Dependency injection parameter introspection is similarly computed once and reused, eliminating per-request `inspect.iscoroutine()` and `inspect.signature()` calls.

**Lazy Parsing:** Query string decoding is skipped when the query string is empty. Body reading is skipped entirely for GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and DELETE requests. Headers are pre-allocated with `HashMap::with_capacity()`.

**Fast-Path Skipping:** Empty middleware chains, empty guard lists, and empty lifecycle hook lists short-circuit immediately without any overhead -- no lock acquisition, no GIL interaction, no function calls.

**Atomic Operations:** The DI container uses `AtomicBool` instead of `RwLock` for the singleton existence check, eliminating lock contention on every request.

**Single-Threaded Tokio Runtime (Zero GIL Contention):** Each worker process runs a single-threaded Tokio event loop instead of a multi-threaded runtime. This eliminates GIL contention entirely -- no Tokio threads compete for `Python::with_gil`. Parallelism comes from multi-process `os.fork()` + SO_REUSEPORT, not from multi-threading. This is the single largest performance optimization in Cello.

**Multi-Process Workers (SO_REUSEPORT):** On Linux, Cello uses `os.fork()` to spawn N+1 worker processes (N children + parent), each binding to the same port via `SO_REUSEPORT`. The Linux kernel distributes connections across workers, bypassing the Python GIL bottleneck and achieving near-linear scaling with core count. On Windows, Cello uses subprocess re-execution with the `CELLO_WORKER=1` environment variable, since `os.fork()` and `SO_REUSEPORT` are not available.

**Ultra-Fast Response Bypass:** For the most common case (handler returns a dict, no middleware), Cello bypasses the intermediate `Response` struct entirely and builds the hyper response directly -- eliminating HashMap allocation, header copying, and extra body copies.

**Direct Python-to-JSON Bytes Serialization:** Handler return values (dicts, lists, primitives) are serialized directly to JSON bytes in a single pass, skipping the intermediate `serde_json::Value` tree allocation entirely.

**Network Optimizations:** `TCP_NODELAY` disables Nagle's algorithm for lower latency. HTTP/1.1 keep-alive and pipelining are enabled by default.

**Metrics Optimization:** Latency tracking uses sampled VecDeque recording (every 64th request) to avoid write lock contention under high load.

**Build Profile:** The release binary is compiled with full link-time optimization (`lto = "fat"`), single codegen unit, `panic = "abort"` (no unwinding overhead), stripped debug symbols, and disabled integer overflow checks.

## What's New Since v0.10.0

v1.0.1 is primarily a performance, stability, and polish release on top of the feature-complete v0.10.0. The following changes are specific to this release:

### Added

- Handler metadata caching (async detection and DI parameter introspection cached per handler)
- Lazy query parsing and body reading for bodyless HTTP methods
- Pre-allocated headers HashMap with known capacity
- Fast-path skip for empty middleware chains, guards, and lifecycle hooks
- Atomic `has_py_singletons` check (replaces RwLock with AtomicBool)
- TCP_NODELAY on accepted connections
- HTTP/1.1 keep-alive and pipeline flush
- VecDeque ring buffer for O(1) latency tracking
- Zero-copy response body building
- Thread-local cached regex in OpenAPI generation
- Optimized release profile: `lto = "fat"`, `panic = "abort"`, `strip = true`, `overflow-checks = false`
- Semantic versioning commitment: all public APIs are frozen

### Fixed

- Handler introspection overhead (per-request `inspect` module import eliminated)
- O(n) latency tracking with `Vec::remove(0)` (replaced with VecDeque)
- Async middleware chain cloning entire middleware vector per request
- DI container acquiring RwLock on every request for singleton existence check
- Lifecycle hooks acquiring GIL even when no hooks are registered
- `println!` on circuit breaker state transitions (replaced with `tracing::warn!`)
- OpenAPI regex recompilation on every path parameter extraction

### Cross-Platform Fixes (v1.0.1)

- **Windows multi-worker**: Replaced broken `multiprocessing.Process` with subprocess re-execution (`CELLO_WORKER=1` environment variable) for reliable multi-worker operation on Windows
- **Windows signal handling**: Wrapped `SIGTERM` registration in `try/except` with platform validation, since `SIGTERM` is not available on Windows
- **Windows static files**: Fixed UNC path normalization to correctly resolve static file paths on Windows filesystems
- **Linux-only CPU affinity**: Gated `os.sched_setaffinity()` calls behind platform detection with a warning on non-Linux platforms where CPU affinity is not supported
- **ARM JSON fallback**: Added `serde_json` fallback for JSON serialization on non-SIMD architectures (e.g., ARM) where `simd-json` is not available

### Compatibility Fixes (v1.0.1)

- **Async handler validation**: `wrap_handler_with_validation` now correctly detects and supports `async def` handlers in addition to synchronous handlers
- **Async guard wrappers**: `_apply_guards` creates async or sync wrappers based on the handler type, preventing coroutine-related errors when guards are applied to async handlers
- **Async cache decorator**: The `cache()` decorator now supports `async def` handlers, properly awaiting the wrapped function
- **Blueprint validation and guards**: Blueprint route decorators (`@bp.get`, `@bp.post`, etc.) now accept a `guards` parameter and support DTO validation, matching the `App` route decorator API
- **Guards exported in `__all__`**: `RoleGuard`, `PermissionGuard`, `Authenticated`, `And`, `Or`, `Not`, `GuardError`, and `ForbiddenError`, `UnauthorizedError` are now included in `cello.__all__` for proper public API exposure
- **Database exports in `__all__`**: `Database`, `Redis`, and `Transaction` are now included in `cello.__all__`

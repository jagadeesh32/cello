# v1.0.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** February 2026

Cello **v1.0.0** marks the first **stable, production-ready release** of the framework. After ten iterative beta releases that built out a comprehensive feature set -- from core HTTP routing to advanced enterprise patterns -- the API is now frozen under [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). No breaking changes will be introduced until v2.0.

## Highlights

- :material-check-decagram: **Production Stable** - The public API is finalized. Semantic versioning guarantees backwards compatibility for all 1.x releases.
- :material-speedometer: **Major Performance Optimizations** - Handler metadata caching, lazy body parsing, zero-copy responses, TCP_NODELAY, and optimized release builds deliver peak throughput.
- :material-feature-search: **Complete Feature Set** - Every feature from v0.3.0 through v0.10.0 is included, tested, and production-ready.
- :material-shield-check: **Enterprise Ready** - OpenTelemetry, health checks, RBAC guards, circuit breaker, Event Sourcing, CQRS, and Saga patterns ship out of the box.

## Performance Improvements

v1.0.0 includes a comprehensive set of hot-path optimizations that significantly reduce per-request overhead:

### Handler Caching (`src/handler.rs`)

- **Cached async detection** -- Whether a handler is `async def` or `def` is now determined once and stored per handler. Previous versions called Python's `inspect.iscoroutine()` on every request.
- **Cached DI parameter introspection** -- Dependency injection parameter metadata is introspected once at first invocation and reused, eliminating per-request `inspect.signature()` calls.
- **Atomic fast-path** -- When no DI singletons are registered, handler invocation skips all DI logic via a single atomic check.

### Server Hot Path (`src/server/mod.rs`)

- **Lazy query parsing** -- Query string decoding is skipped entirely when the query string is empty.
- **Pre-allocated headers** -- `HashMap::with_capacity()` eliminates rehashing during header collection.
- **Lazy body reading** -- GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and DELETE requests skip body reading entirely.
- **Skip empty middleware** -- Middleware chain execution is bypassed when no middleware is registered.
- **Skip empty guards** -- Guard checking is bypassed when no guards are registered.
- **TCP_NODELAY** -- Nagle's algorithm is disabled on accepted connections for lower latency.
- **HTTP/1.1 keep-alive + pipeline flush** -- Connection reuse and pipelining enabled by default.
- **VecDeque for latencies** -- O(1) ring buffer replaces O(n) `Vec::remove(0)` for latency tracking.
- **Zero-copy response body** -- Response bodies use `Bytes::copy_from_slice` for efficient transfer.

### Middleware & Dependencies

- **Async middleware lock optimization** -- Middleware chain collects `Arc` references under a short read lock, then releases the lock before any `await`.
- **Atomic `has_py_singletons`** -- DI container uses `AtomicBool` instead of `RwLock` for the singleton existence check.
- **Lifecycle hook fast-path** -- Empty hook lists return immediately without acquiring the GIL.
- **Circuit breaker logging** -- Replaced `println!` with `tracing::warn!` on the hot path.
- **Thread-local regex** -- OpenAPI path parameter regex is compiled once per thread instead of per call.

### Build Configuration (`Cargo.toml`)

- `lto = "fat"` -- Full link-time optimization across all crates.
- `panic = "abort"` -- Eliminates unwinding overhead.
- `strip = true` -- Strips debug symbols from the release binary.
- `overflow-checks = false` -- Disables integer overflow checks in release mode.

## Stability Guarantees

Starting with v1.0.0, Cello follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Patch releases** (1.0.x) -- Bug fixes and security patches only. No API changes.
- **Minor releases** (1.x.0) -- New features added in a backwards-compatible manner. Existing code continues to work.
- **Major releases** (2.0.0+) -- Reserved for breaking changes, with a migration guide and deprecation period.

The following are considered part of the stable public API:

- All classes and functions exported in `cello.__all__`
- Route decorator signatures (`@app.get`, `@app.post`, etc.)
- `Request` and `Response` object APIs
- Middleware configuration classes
- Blueprint API
- Dependency injection (`Depends`)
- Guard system (`RoleGuard`, `PermissionGuard`)

---

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed handler introspection overhead causing per-request Python `inspect` module import
- Fixed O(n) latency tracking in metrics causing CPU overhead under high request volume
- Fixed async middleware chain cloning entire middleware vector per request
- Fixed dependency container acquiring `RwLock` on every request for singleton existence check
- Fixed lifecycle hooks acquiring GIL even when no hooks are registered
- Fixed `println!` on circuit breaker state transitions causing I/O on the hot path
- Fixed OpenAPI regex recompilation on every path parameter extraction

## Migration Guide

See the [Migration Guide](migration.md#010x-to-10x) for detailed upgrade instructions.

### Quick Migration

1. Update your dependency:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade cello-framework
   ```

2. **No breaking changes.** All existing v0.10.0 code works without modification.

3. Verify your application:
   ```python
   import cello
   assert cello.__version__ == "1.0.0"
   ```
